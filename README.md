# qb-garagemenu
## This is script is working with [radialmenu](https://github.com/bashenga/radialmenu) | [nh-context](https://github.com/nerohiro/nh-context)

### I just wrote this instead of editing qb-garages. All you need is this for interact garages with radial menu.
### Right now working with Normal Garages and Depots. 

# You need to change your @qb-garages\SharedConfig.lua with @qb-garagemenu\to qb-garages\SharedConfig.lua
